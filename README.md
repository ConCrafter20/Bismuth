I mean everyone has a mod named after an element

## How to install
It's very simple:
1. Go to [fabricmc.net](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) and download the installer
2. Install the version you want and the version that I support
3. Run it once.
4. Then go to directory where you installed it then drag the .jar into the ```mods``` folder
5. Run the client again and the mod should be installed
